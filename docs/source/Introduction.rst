What is GSD ?
*************
Game Server Daemon is a process that allows you to easily control one or multiple game servers via a Rest API.
For example, if you want to make your own Game Server control panel, you can do it without reinventing the wheel, and If you want to make / delete servers on the fly from a plugin you can do that too.

GSD is very flexible, you can easily add support for your own games or new interfaces to access them.

Features :
 * Creating servers
 * Start / Stop servers
 * Crash detection
 * Easily access query data
 * Editing configuration files
 * FTP Management
 * Plugin support for Minecraft (others to come)
 * User Rights and authentication
